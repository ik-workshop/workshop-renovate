So it should be a safe replacement for the current default:\n`'./**/*.md' './**/*.html'`. It should also be faster and will use less file-handles than glob patterns.\n\n#### Other highlights of lychee 0.8.2:\n\n-   Improve concurrency with streams (https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/pull/330)\n-   Fix false-positives for special Github URLs (like /sponsors or /marketplace)\n-   Add support for `.lycheeignore` file https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues/308 (https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/pull/402)\n\nEspecially the `.lycheeignore` part should be helpful for folks that used workarounds like custom ignore files before.\nThis is now a native feature of lychee. See https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/issues/308 for more info.\n\nFull lychee 0.8.2 changelog [here](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee/releases/tag/v0.8.2).\n"},"expiry":"2022-02-13T16:01:11.666+00:00"}
