This Merge Request has been created with the help of [renovate-gitlab-bot] project.

## What are the next steps?

If you have been assigned as a reviewer to this Merge Request,
please review this Merge Request with the same scrutiny as any community contribution:

1.  Ensure that the dependencies updated meet our standards:

    - _Security_: Dependencies do not contain malicious code
    - _Performance_: Dependencies do not bloat the application code or prolong CI times unnecessarily
    - _Stability_: Pipelines are passing

2.  If tests are passing and you've reviewed the updated dependencies, execute pipelines in the [context of the main project][main_context]

    This MR is created from a fork, therefore not _all_ jobs (e.g. Danger) might have been executed.
    Instead of hitting MWPS right away, you might want to wait until the pipeline you've just triggered finished.

    _Note_: This might not be available in projects, in that case merging right away is an option

3.  Merge away!
